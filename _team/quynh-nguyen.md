> April 2023 marked a sudden turning point in my life and many Sudanese people as war broke out in Sudan. As chaos started escalating in Khartoum we were forced to leave our house, and I watched the Rapid Support Forces militia looting all of our assets. To continue my educational journey, I traveled to Egypt leaving my parents behind and sat for Cambridge IGCSE exams in Egypt. While there was struggle and chaos, I challenged myself and I completed eight subjects and came in with seven A*s and one A. Since then, I have been driven by the desire to ensure that others do not face the same obstacles I once encountered.

> Going back 2020 during COVID time, I helped founding Gadeemteam with my two brothers. Volunteering with Gadeemteam has contributing greatly to my personal growth, especially after the war erupted in Sudan. Aligning with Gadeemteam’s mission, make high-quality education accessible and affordable (SDG 4), I provided 34 hours free lessons, 52 hours low-cost lessons, built a Drive for resources for 11 subjects and created a WhatsApp group with 400+ members after I received my results in January 2024.

> The UWC STEM for Peace project was born out of a desire to use the STEM knowledge I have learned at UWC Changshu to real-life challenges. I am deeply passionate about this initiative because it embodies UWC’s mission, promoting education and peace, even in the face of the struggles of being a refugee. Through this project, I hope to give back to UWC by advancing its mission in a tangible way and empowering marginalized students through education.
