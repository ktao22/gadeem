> I would love to give back to UWC through this project. I am immensely grateful for the opportunities at UWC that opened me to so many different perspectives. By chance, meeting Mohamed, sharing our very different stories and collaborating on different projects together in the Peace Council sparked our idea of combining both of our interests to educate for peace. 

> The language barrier is a challenge. However, I recently began my journey learning Arabic. This is more of an opportunity than a challenge to immerse in a totally different culture. Personally, UWC STEM for Peace would be a huge life-changing initiative to carry out in a totally new country, and lead to many meaningful experiences.
